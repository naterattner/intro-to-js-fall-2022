        <p>Whose woods these are I think I know.
          His house is in the village though;
          He will not see me stopping here
          To watch his woods fill up with snow.
          My little horse must think it queer
          To stop without a farmhouse near
          Between the woods and frozen lake
          The darkest evening of the year.
          He gives his harness bells a shake
          To ask if there is some mistake.
          The only other soundâ€™s the sweep
          Of easy wind and downy flake.
          The woods are lovely, dark and deep,
          But I have promises to keep,
          And miles to go before I sleep,
          And miles to go before I sleep.
